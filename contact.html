<p style="color:rgb(0,255,0);">Thank you for your interest in my programs! If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to email me and I will reply as soon as possible. However, I am by no means an expert! I'm just a hobbyist fascinated with early 8-bit computers!</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,255,0);">Most of the programs for vintage 8-bit computers are also available as a REAL physical copy, with a 5.25 inch floppy disk. I definitely recommend this for the full, authentic experience! Some of the larger programs, such as Map Maker, also come with an extensive printed and bound manual. If you want, another option is include all the programs on one disk.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,255,0);">Disk images are free to download. Floppy disk copies are $10, and larger programs with a manual are $25. This is mostly to recover costs, and a small amount to support the project. Floppy disks obviously aren't being manufactured anymore (as far as I know), so the disks I will send you are "new old stock." This means that they're old but were still in sealed, brand new condition. If you're interested, send me an email and let me know which programs you want. I can accept payment by Paypal, or the old fashioned way with a money order if you prefer.</p>
