<p style="color:rgb(0,0,255);">Hello, visitor! My name is Christian Tobar, or as most people call me - just "Chris." My many hobbies include programming, writing, astronomy, photography, and local history. I'm a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, I guess! More recently, I have become fascinated with vintage 8-bit computers. The Lab6502 website spun off from this, and my search for an easier way to share the Apple II BASIC programs I made with other enthusiasts.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,255);">Unfortunately, I didn't get to fully experience the heyday of 8-bit era computers. I was too young. As a small child in the early 1980's, my only experience with computers at the time was mostly playing simple educational games at school, such as "Oregon Trail." I was well aware of computers from movies and using them from time to time at school, but didn't have much other hands-on experience with them. My family didn't have a personal computer at the time. In fact, most people didn't. It might be hard to imagine today, but in the 80's and early 90's, computers were <i>extremely</i>expensive and they were a luxury that many families just couldn't afford. I didn't get my own computer at home until 1999!</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,255);">Years later, I decided I wanted to learn how to program. The idea of being able to make a computer do exactly what <i>I wanted</i> it to do fascinated me. I taught myself programming with QuickBasic and Visual Basic, and started making my own programs and games for Windows. I was hooked! I tried C++ for a little while, but my true love has always been BASIC.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,255);">At some point, I became interested in vintage 8-bit computers. I guess you could say I "rediscovered" them, since I was actually around during the 8-bit era, but I was too young to fully participate. I'm not sure exactly what first drew me back to these old computers. Maybe nostalgia from my time playing Oregon Trail and other games at school? Maybe it was just my curiosity about old things in general? I find modern stuff to be boring and drab. Everything looks the same. 8-bit computers had a kind of character and feel that is completely missing today. And there is just something fulfilling about working with real floppy disks! In any case, I learned how to program vintage computers with BASIC...which was an entirely new experience for me. There are a lot of limitations in working with old 8-bit computers, but instead of being a frustration, it's actually a very rewarding challenge. In fact, I've found that there are some features they have that I wish modern computers still had today!</p>       

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,255);">These days, programming and writing have become my main hobbies. I've had to put some of my other interests on the back burner. In 2014, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease called Sjogren's Syndrome. Although I actually suffered with bizarre symptoms for several years before that, and it completely turned my life upside down. Things that most people take for granted are a major struggle for me. As a result, I've had to find new ways to adapt and accept a "new normal." Although I'm young, my health problems have left me unable to work at a regular job. I'm currently trying to find creative ways to use what I've learned to support myself and my hobbies. I refuse to let this disease destroy me. I may be down, but I'm not out!</p>  

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,255);">I love to meet new people, especially other enthusiasts! If you have any questions, please feel free to email me!</p>
